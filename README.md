# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Application Using Streamlit

![EDA Application](https://github.com/vipulc2580/EDA_Application-Using-Streamlit/blob/main/UI.png)

## What the Project Is

This project is a web-based application designed for performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** efficiently and interactively. Built using **Streamlit**, the app provides an intuitive interface for:

- Uploading datasets
- Visualizing key statistics
- Generating detailed plots and charts
- Understanding data distributions, correlations, and trends

It simplifies the process of analyzing datasets and helps users make informed decisions by providing powerful visual and analytical tools.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Easily upload your datasets in CSV format.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: View summary statistics, including mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs, and more.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understand relationships between variables with correlation matrices.
- **Customizable Options**: Adjust visualization parameters for a tailored experience.
